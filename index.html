          <p class="card-text">Hi, I‚Äôm Ankita! üëãüèΩ

            I'm passionate about teaching front-end technologies and growing people in their careers.
            
            I have over 10 years of experience in the tech industry starting with helping small businesses develop apps. I transitioned from a Senior Developer to a Solution Architect, aka Staff Developer and then decided to transition to leadership. I have been leading teams and helped define the future of FinTech in Canada.
            
            Previously, I worked as a Senior Engineering Manager, Tech Lead, Solution Architect, and Lead developer at companies such as WealthSimple, Loblaw Digital, Rangle.io, and IBM Canada. I have architected and scaled many web and mobile apps for clients using React, GraphQL, React Native and Next.js. You may know some of them: Tim Hortons, Burger King, Popeyes, Borrowell, WealthSimple, Moleskine and more.</p>

            I also enjoy teaching and public speaking, so I created a course on Next.js and love giving conference talks worldwide! You can check it out here: https://bit.ly/3nRIsbi
            
            As a senior leader, I have grown a lot of folks in my career, and my mission is to help mentor folks in all stages of their career. I also believe that no question is a wrong question, so please don't hesitate to reach out.
            
            I genuinely enjoy mentoring, and it is a 2-way street as I'm sure I'll be learning lots from you too!
