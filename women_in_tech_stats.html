          <p>
            As we can see from their research there is a glaring disparity as early as highschool with 83% of boys
            choosing to study a STEM field and only 64% girls, a 19% difference despite the fact that girls are
            consistently achieving better grades than boys.
          </p>
          <p>
            At University this imbalance continues to grow with 52% of men studying STEM while the number of women has
            more than halved from 64% down to 30%
          </p>
          <p class="mb-0">
            However the biggest drop off is after University when men and women enter the workforce. 15% of men will see
            a career in STEM as their first choice, with women that has fallen to as low as 3%! A staggering 90%
            decrease from the number of women who studied STEM at university.

            If more support were offered to girls/women early on in their STEM journey then we wouldn't have the
            imbalance we see today in tech. Also if a woman was considering a career change, the next question is where
            do i start? What is the road map?
          </p>
          <p>
            This project aims to help address this issue. On this site women who are currently working in the field of
            tech can create a profile free of charge and volunteer to help mentor and assist any young woman who is
            early on in her tech journey.
          </p>
          <p>
            Women who are currently in school, in university, or who are very early on in their tech careers can also
            create a profile and brows to see what mentors are currently available that might be able to offer help,
            advice and mentoring for the field that they are interested in.
          </p>
          <!-- <p class="mb-0">Highlight how the road map is already there, look at Code Institute. They have a well-laid out
            and structured learning programme. They offer nearly 24/7 online tutor support, dedicated slack channels
            where fellow students and alumni can help advise and solve your current coding problems, and they also offer
            career guidance and recruitment opportunities after you have graduated. Their diploma course is also
            university accredited so you will have a diploma to your name as well.</p> -->

          <p>Gemma Church from women in tech wrote recently <cite>“Tech is probably the only field that allows you to
              work on anything from anywhere”</cite></p>
          <p>Standard benefits that you can expect with most tech companies are:</p>
          <!-- Ordered list of benefits -->
          <ol class="mb-3">
            <li>Work from home and hybrid working environments (No more long commutes)</li>
            <li>Flexible hours, not glued to a desk from 9am until 5pm (Flexible working allows for a better work. life
              balance)</li>
            <li>The majority of tech companies offer maternity & paternity leave on full pay</li>
            <li>Private medical health insurance</li>
          </ol>
          <p>Rather than write a whole list about how rewarding a career in tech can be for women, why don't you hear
            from the women themselves who have already landed that tech job and are working in the field.</p>
